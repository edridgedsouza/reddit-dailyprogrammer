# Reddit /r/dailyprogrammer attempts

This is my repo of attempts at problems on reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer. Currently, this includes two primary subdirectories: `./posts` and `./get-post`.

The directory ./get-post contains a Python3 command-line tool to download and organize the post instructions for any post on the subreddit. This allows you to keep the post guidelines closeby when coding multiple challenges at once. It also gives you a simple organization system that makes it easy to find past solutions to any given programming challenge.

Feel free to use or modify my script in `./get-post` to organize your /r/dailyprogrammer scripts. You may also look at my attempts at the actual posts, but remember that the spirit of the subreddit is to create your own work and not rely too heavily on existing work.

Enjoy!
