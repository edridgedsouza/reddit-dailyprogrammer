# get-post.py

This is a command-line tool to download and organize posts from reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer.

The syntax of this tool is `./get-post.py [challenge] [difficulty]`. The challenge number is whatever is displayed in the title in the form "Challenge #___", and the difficulty is an int, where 1 is "easy", 2 is "medium/intermediate", and 3 is "hard/difficult".

This script downloads the post text into the directory `../posts`. Feel free to use, redistribute, and modify it as long as you provide some credit.

Enjoy!
